Here's a list of what your final project should do.

1. Display a list of images:
 - Make a GET request to /image to retrieve an array of JSON objects. The JSON object will contain an “url” attribute pointing to a target image.
 - Images should be loaded asynchronously
2. Allow editing of an image
 - Allow user to apply a filter
 - Allow user to overlay text
 - Allow some other interesting image edits.. be creative
3. Save the image
 - Make a GET request to /upload which will return a JSON object with a "url" attribute to which the image can be uploaded.
 - Upload the edited image file to the given url, using a POST request with a multipart/form-data encoding type. The form should include the following fields:
    - appid: a string unique to your project (e.g. your email address)
    - original: the url of the original image the user edited
    - file: the image file being uploaded
